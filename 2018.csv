First of all, sorry, English is not my main language, so please bare with me. I work in an IT consulting firm and I faced 2 burnouts, clients were to blame every-time because they were looking for code monkeys instead of software crafts·men·women that care a  about quality (the vast majority of my coworkers). My company was supportive, I had the time to put myself back together but no real solution was found (yet) to prevent consultants to be appointed to unhealthy environments. But they are working on it. In France, it's called occupational stress prevention (prévention des risques psychosociaux), many people here fell very uneasy about the term mental health, to be honest, I really don't know what to do to raise awareness about this issue. ",Yes,1,"It was a mixed bag. We all react differently to oppression (that lead to depression) in the workplace. Some said to me to ""man up"" some others were compassionate. I described my experiences and detailed the many defence mechanisms I developed over the years to fight against unhealthy behaviours. Oppression, alienation at work, sexism, lack of quality in our craft, lack of empathy, rejected ideas for unfair and political reasons and so on. Politics is everywhere nowadays, I believe that everyone is politically engaged and it's hard to find a common ground that allow us to move forward.",1,"One of my coworker faced the same issue as me back then, I was alerted by my human resource manager to help him out. I was grateful to be part of that process and I believe I helped him to recover a bit. We discussed about the gap that exist between the corporate culture of the client he was working with and his desire as a software craftsman. I told him that it wasn't his fault, that he was doing what felt right to him, but his arguments was falling on deaf ears, they weren't interested about his expertise, they just wanted a mindless robot that can work tirelessly without asking too much questions.
